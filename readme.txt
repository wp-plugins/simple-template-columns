Simple template columns is a simple plugin that puts focus on one thing, to easily let you create columns in your templates.

== Description ==

This plugin was made with developers in mind. Being a developer myself I stumbled across the annoyance of creating multi-column templates every time I needed to. Therefore I created this plugin to solve the issue. The plugin registers two new functions called getColumn and countColumns and they both work in a very simple manner.

I recommend the plugin called [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/ "Go to plugin page") in order to create custom fields. *More information on custom fields can be found in the FAQ.*

The columns are created by using the more-tag in the content. As simple as that!
**Refer to the FAQ to learn more about the usage of this plugin.**


== Installation ==

To perform a manual install, do the following:

1. Upload the 'simple-template-columns' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enjoy, and let me know if you run into any issues!
